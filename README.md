A Pokémon search app allows users to look up detailed information about various Pokémon species.
Here are some typical features that the app include:

Pokémon Database: A comprehensive database of all available Pokémon, including their names, types, abilities, stats, and evolutions. Users can search for specific Pokémon by name, type, or generation.

Search and Filter: Advanced search options allow users to filter Pokémon by attributes like type (Fire, Water, Grass), base stats (attack, defense, speed), or by their evolutionary stages.

Pokédex Functionality: Mimics the Pokédex feature from the Pokémon games, presenting each Pokémon's description, abilities, habitat, and entry number.

Stat Charts and Comparisons: View and compare Pokémon stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

Move List and Abilities: Information on each Pokémon’s moveset, including level-up moves, TM/HM compatibility, and egg moves.

Evolution Chains: Visualization of how a Pokémon evolves, including special conditions for evolution (e.g., stones, trading, friendship).

Type Matchup Calculator: A tool that shows the strengths and weaknesses of a Pokémon based on its type(s). This can help with battle strategy by showing which types deal double damage or resist certain types.

Location Tracking: For apps that connect to games like Pokémon Go, they may offer location services to track Pokémon sightings or show nearby locations where certain Pokémon are found.

Favorites and Teams: Users can save their favorite Pokémon and create teams for battle planning.
